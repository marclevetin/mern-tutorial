# Overview
This project was my first attempt in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).  I followed a tutorial found here: https://medium.com/@bryantheastronaut/react-getting-started-the-mern-stack-tutorial-feat-es6-de1a2886be50.  Because the tutorial was close to a year old, there were many changes to tools used, especially with Create-React-App and Mongoose.

## Things I learned/used for the first time.
1. Postman
2. Mongo
3. Express
4. Node
5. Putting CSS in a JS wrapper
6. Assorted tools:
Axios: let us use HTTP methods to communicate with our database.
Express: provide a framework to set up our Node.js server.
Body Parser: parse the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending (gives us access to `req.body` which we will be using soon).
Foreman: allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.
Nodemon: watches our server.js file for changes, then restarts it.
Marked: to convert markdown syntax to html. I used this in place of Remarkable (which the FB tutorial uses)
Mongoose: abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.
