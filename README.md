# Overview
This project was my first attempt in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).  I followed a tutorial found here: https://medium.com/@bryantheastronaut/react-getting-started-the-mern-stack-tutorial-feat-es6-de1a2886be50.  Because the tutorial was close to a year old, there were many changes to tools used, especially with Create-React-App and Mongoose.
